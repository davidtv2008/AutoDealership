<p> <h3>You will have the ability to the following: </h3>
<h3>Inventory Management</h3>

View inventory with a single key press. Sort the inventory list by Make, Model, Stock Number or Days in Inventory. Click on any entry to view or edit the full inventory information, including: VIN Number, License Plate, Stock Number, Mileage and DMV Title Status. Track all expenses by stock number including: Flooring, Reconditioning, Commissions and Purchases. Print Bar Codes, Labels, Jacket Sheets, Buyer's Guides, and Window Stickers (Black & White and Color).

Integration with Kelly Blue Book®, Black Book® and NADA data is available through optional modules. 

<h3>VIN Decoding</h3>

As you add cars to the Inventory, you can use DeskManager's build-in VIN Decoder to decode Year, Make, Model, Series, Body Style, and Engine. 

<h3>Deal Making</h3>

Every new deal starts with various fields pre-populated automatically from default values you specify. Popular examples include: warranty, County and State tax rates, license, doc prep and many other items specific to your state and county.

One-Pay, semi-monthly, monthly, bi-weekly, and weekly payments of either Compound or Add-on interest options are available.

The Roll-back feature, which allows you to reverse calculations to arrive at Cash Price, Interest Rate, Down Payment, Finance Charge, and Out-The-Door price, is an invaluable tool to work with customers on "What if..." scenarios, to help you close more deals.

Deals may have up to four deferred payments with automatic late charge posting and late notice printing. Up to 2 Trade-ins may be added to the inventory as soon as deals are sold, avoiding duplicate data entry.

Quick Deal provides a fast and easy method of showing and printing cash and finance deal structures. The information can then be printed with or without displayed finance charges. 

<h3>Buy-Here Pay-Here</h3>

Cash, in-house and third party lender transactions are supported by the internal accounting and financial reporting system. In-House financing and Buy-Here Pay-Here dealers have all the tools necessary to operate, including: multiple bank accounts, check writing and reconciliation, payment coupons, late notices, repo letters, buyback and un-wind procedures, complete with invoice generation and tracking for expenses occurring after the sale.

All customers, vendors and employee information and histories are maintained and available for lookup or detailed reporting.

Report Writer

The Report Writer lets you create your own reports in addition to many popular canned reports already provided. There are over 150 reportable fields from the Deal and Inventory tables. Creating reports is really easy!
